# Week4-CodeQuiz

This weeks homework was to create a timed quiz web application that has multiple choices. When the correct choice is made, you recieve a message saying that the answer was right, and moves you on to the next question. If you make a selection that is wrong, 10 seconds get deducted off your time and you are moved to the next question. At the end of the quiz, there is a form to put your initials, which when submitted, gets saved to the local storage and posted on the highscores page that will also populate once the submit button is pressed. Please see the below screenshot and link to the web application.
